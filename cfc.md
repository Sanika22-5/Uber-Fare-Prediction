Model Selection
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Regression
- **Reason**: Handles both linear and non-linear relationships effectively

### Feature Selection
- The distance feature was identified as a key predictor for fare amounts.

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 2.32
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: 18.50
- **R² Score**: 0.794 (explains 79.4% of variance in fare amounts)

## Recommendations

1. **Pricing Strategies**:
   - Dynamic pricing for longer rides
   - Loyalty points for frequent short-distance rides
2. **Operational Improvements**:
   - Surge pricing during peak hours
   - Automated outlier detection systems
3. **Customer Experience**:
   - Display predicted fare ranges before trip confirmation
   - Offer shared ride incentives

## Conclusion

The model demonstrates high accuracy and practical applications in predicting Uber fares. Future improvements could include integrating additional features like weather and traffic data.

Data Preprocessing
Key steps in preprocessing:

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Initial Exploration: Reviewed column names, data types, and dataset shape
Missing Data: Removed rows with null values
Feature Engineering: Added a distance column using the Haversine formula
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution Analysis: Most fares are between 
20, reflecting short or low-cost trips
Outlier Removal: Excluded non-plausible fare and distance values
Correlation: Found a strong positive correlation (0.89) between fare amount and distance
